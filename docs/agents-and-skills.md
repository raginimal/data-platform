# Agents and Skills Framework

```text
POLICY -> SKILL -> AGENT -> WORKFLOW -> HUMAN
```

- **Policy:** defines what must be true.
- **Skill:** defines how one focused analysis is performed.
- **Agent:** selects applicable skills and consolidates findings.
- **Workflow:** supplies changed files, policy context, and review context.
- **Human:** makes accountable decisions for risk, exceptions, production, and required approvals.

## Routing

The initial change-aware routing contract is in `config/ai/agent-routing.yaml`. It is a configurable default, not a complete project classifier. Agents should select only relevant skills after reviewing changed paths, declared impact, policy IDs, and available evidence.

## Deterministic boundary

Formatting, linting, tests, secret scanning, SAST, IaC validation, dependency checks, policy validation, artifact verification, and deployment protections remain deterministic. Agents provide reasoning, context, trade-off analysis, and recommendations around those results.

## Human boundary

Agents cannot approve findings, exceptions, risk acceptance, production, IAM, merges, or deployments. Human reviewers remain accountable for defined decisions in the approval matrix.

## Architecture baseline impact

The Baseline Guard (`bash scripts/validate-baseline.sh`) reports which baseline boundaries a change touches and which agents they name. Architecture changes go to the Architecture Agent (`ARCH-SK-001` baseline impact review); IAM, infrastructure, and deployment boundaries add the Security & DevOps Agent; AI integration and model boundaries add the AI Engineering Agent plus the Architecture Agent. Agents recommend only: they cannot approve an architecture change, modify the baseline, waive an ADR, or bypass CI.

## Versioning

Every agent and skill has an ID, version, owner placeholder, applicable policies, and reviewable repository history. Changes to a skill or agent are governance changes because they can affect engineering review outcomes.
