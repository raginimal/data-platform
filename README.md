# AI Engineering Golden Path

Reusable greenfield AI project engineering framework for developers, architects, security engineers, DevOps engineers, data specialists, AI engineers, and project leads.

The goal is simple: **make the correct engineering path the easiest path for new AI projects.**

## Overview

This repository is a technology-neutral reusable project skeleton, not an application. It provides a repeatable foundation for:

- Repository structure and developer context
- Engineering, architecture, DevOps, security, data, and AI policies
- Developer workflow, branching, pull requests, ownership, and risk review
- Deterministic CI and policy enforcement
- Artifact provenance, environment promotion, IaC boundaries, and rollback hooks
- Custom advisory agents and reusable analysis skills

It standardizes the starting point without removing engineering judgment. Project teams still choose their stack, platform, data boundaries, model providers, thresholds, and accountable owners.

## The Problem

Greenfield AI projects often begin with inconsistent repository structures, late security controls, undocumented architecture, uneven CI/CD, inconsistent AI usage, and different practices for developers using AI assistants. Policies may exist without enforcement, and good patterns are difficult to repeat across teams.

This framework turns those expectations into version-controlled context, policy IDs, developer workflows, deterministic checks, review contracts, and explicit human approval boundaries.

## Core Principle

> **Lock the architecture and engineering boundaries, not every developer decision.**

A greenfield project records its approved architecture baseline at inception in [docs/architecture/baseline.yaml](docs/architecture/baseline.yaml). Developers are free to implement features within those boundaries. A change that crosses an approved boundary is detected and routed for review, and a meaningful architectural deviation requires an ADR and human approval.

The baseline ships as a technology-neutral `draft`. The architecture owner completes it and sets `status: approved` before the ADR requirement is enforced.

## The Golden Path

```text
Project
	-> Repository Skeleton
	-> Engineering Policies and Architecture Baseline
	-> Developer Workflow (feature branch -> pull request)
	-> Architecture Baseline Guard
	-> CI and Policy Enforcement
	-> Relevant Agents and Skills
	-> Human Review
	-> Merge
	-> CD, Environments, and IaC
	-> Deployment
```

Engineering standards are embedded in normal development and review rather than treated as a separate compliance activity.

## Developer Golden Path

Policies say what must be true; the [Developer DevOps Golden Path](docs/developer/devops-developer-guide.html) says what a developer does, from starting a feature to getting it safely into production.

```text
Understand requirement -> check architecture and policies -> feature branch -> develop and test
-> bash scripts/check.sh -> commit -> pull request -> CI -> agent review -> human review -> merge
-> build once -> DEV -> TEST/UAT -> production approval -> PROD -> verify or roll back
```

- **Greenfield:** a new project starts from this skeleton and follows the path from the first commit.
- **Brownfield:** an existing project is not rebuilt. The skeleton is a reference standard for a manual assessment (repository, architecture, DevOps, security, AI engineering), a risk-ranked remediation roadmap, and progressive adoption. The repository contains no assessment tooling.
- **Minimum GitHub setup:** protected `main`, `CODEOWNERS`, the PR template, CI gates, and environment separation with human production approval. An administrator configures GitHub settings from [docs/administrator-setup.md](docs/administrator-setup.md).
- **Who does what:** CI enforces deterministic rules, agents provide advisory findings, and humans approve merges, exceptions, architecture changes, and production.

The detailed, visual guide is [docs/developer/devops-developer-guide.html](docs/developer/devops-developer-guide.html).

## Framework Architecture

```text
POLICY
	 -> SKILL
	 -> AGENT
	 -> WORKFLOW
	 -> CI/CD
	 -> HUMAN
```

- **Policy** defines what must be true.
- **Skill** defines how one focused engineering analysis is performed.
- **Agent** selects applicable skills and provides contextual reasoning.
- **Workflow** defines when checks and reviews happen.
- **CI/CD** performs deterministic validation and delivery controls.
- **Human** remains accountable for risk, exceptions, production, and other defined decisions.

Agents complement deterministic engineering controls. They do not replace CI/CD or human accountability.

The Architecture Baseline fits this model without adding a new layer:

| Element | Role |
|---|---|
| Policy | Defines what must be true. |
| Baseline | Defines the project's approved architectural boundaries. It complements policy and does not replace it. |
| Skill | Explains how a review or check is performed. |
| Agent | Performs contextual analysis and recommends; it never decides. |
| Workflow | Determines when checks happen. |
| CI | Performs deterministic enforcement. |
| Human | Makes and approves significant architecture decisions. |

## Architecture Baseline

The baseline in [docs/architecture/baseline.yaml](docs/architecture/baseline.yaml) records only important project-level boundaries. Its policy is [policies/architecture/architecture-baseline.md](policies/architecture/architecture-baseline.md) (`ARCH-BL-001` to `ARCH-BL-004`).

| Boundary ID | Area |
|---|---|
| `BL-APP` | Application architecture |
| `BL-COMP` | Major components and service boundaries |
| `BL-TECH` | Technology and platform choices |
| `BL-DATA` | Data architecture |
| `BL-AI` | AI integration architecture |
| `BL-MODEL` | AI model provider and family boundary |
| `BL-SEC` | Security and IAM boundaries |
| `BL-DEPLOY` | Deployment architecture |
| `BL-ENV` | Environment structure |
| `BL-CICD` | CI/CD architecture |
| `BL-REPO` | Repository boundaries and ownership |

Each boundary states what is **approved** (`baseline`) and what stays **flexible** (`flexible`), for example a model version bump inside the approved model family. The baseline does not govern implementation detail, and it is not a version-management system.

## Architecture Baseline Guard

The guard is a deterministic script, [scripts/validate-baseline.sh](scripts/validate-baseline.sh), run with `bash scripts/validate-baseline.sh`. It validates the baseline and compares the files changed in a PR with each boundary's `impact_paths` and `change_paths`.

```text
NO_BASELINE_IMPACT
        |
        v
Normal PR workflow

BASELINE_IMPACT
        |
        v
Relevant agent and owner review (CI does not fail)

ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE
        |
        v
ADR / architecture review
        |
        v
Human approval
```

- **Where it runs:** the "Detect architecture baseline impact" step in [policy.yml](.github/workflows/policy.yml) on pull requests. The scenario tests are in [scripts/test-baseline-guard.sh](scripts/test-baseline-guard.sh) (`bash scripts/test-baseline-guard.sh`).
- **What it prints:** the component, baseline, change, changed files, classification, and the required reviews, including the agents named by the matched boundaries.
- **What it enforces:** an `ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE` needs an ADR with `Baseline impact: change`, and a change to `baseline.yaml` also needs `Baseline update: yes`. The guard fails on a missing or malformed ADR only when the baseline is `approved`; while it is `draft` it warns.
- **What it does not do:** it does not judge whether a change is acceptable, run agents, or approve anything. Matching is path-based.

The guard is one check inside CI, not CI itself: CI is the pipeline that runs all deterministic checks.

### Architecture changes

A normal feature needs no ADR. An architecture change uses the existing ADR mechanism ([docs/adr/](docs/adr/), [template](docs/adr/template.md)).

| Change | Example path | Guard result | Review |
|---|---|---|---|
| Add business feature | `src/customer_summary.py` | `NO_BASELINE_IMPACT` | Normal development |
| Replace approved database | `infrastructure/database/` | `ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE` | Architecture + Security & DevOps agents, ADR, human approval |
| Change IAM boundary | `infrastructure/iam/` | `BASELINE_IMPACT` | Security & DevOps + Architecture agents, security and architecture owners |
| Change AI model | `ai/models/` | `BASELINE_IMPACT` | AI Engineering + Architecture agents, AI owner |
| Change prompt wording only | `ai/prompts/` | `NO_BASELINE_IMPACT` unless it is a protected `*contract*` prompt | Normal review |
| Change deployment architecture | `infrastructure/` (Terraform, `cd.yml`) | `ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE` | Security & DevOps + Architecture agents, ADR, human approval |

## Engineering Lifecycle and Status

| Phase | Capability | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Repository Skeleton | Implemented |
| Phase 2 | Policies and Architecture Principles (Engineering, DevOps, Security, Data, AI), including the Architecture Baseline | Implemented |
| Phase 3 | Developer Workflow and Repository Governance, including ADR and approval routing | Implemented as documentation and governance |
| Phase 4 | CI and Deterministic Enforcement, including the Architecture Baseline Guard | Core implemented; stack-specific checks conditional |
| Phase 5 | CD, Environments, and IaC | Foundation implemented; platform deployment remains an overlay |
| Phase 6 | Agents, Skills, and Change-Aware Engineering | Contracts and policies implemented; advisory only |
| Phase 7 | AI Governance and Evaluation | Future |
| Phase 8 | Observability and Learning Loop | Future extension |

Phases 1–6 are the current target scope. “Implemented” means the corresponding repository foundation exists; it does not mean every project-specific tool, owner, cloud environment, or runtime adapter is configured.

The Architecture Baseline is integrated into these phases rather than added as a new one: the baseline and its `ARCH-BL-*` policies belong to Phase 2, the ADR and approval workflow to Phase 3, the Baseline Guard to Phase 4, and the baseline impact review (`ARCH-SK-001`) and routing to Phase 6.

## Policies

Policies are the source of engineering intent. They use stable identifiers, normative `MUST`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY` language, exception requirements, human decisions, and automation candidates.

Policy domains include:

- Repository: `RP-*`
- Architecture and dependencies: `ARCH-*`, `ARCH-DEP-*`, `ARCH-BL-*` (architecture baseline)
- DevOps and delivery: `DEVOPS-*`
- Security and IAM: `SEC-*`, `SEC-SEC-*`, `SEC-IAM-*`
- Data: `DATA-*`, `DATA-CLS-*`, `DATA-CON-*`
- AI: `AI-*`, `AI-MOD-*`, `AI-PRM-*`, `AI-EVAL-*`, `AI-AGT-*`

For example, `SEC-SEC-001` prohibits secrets in Git, while `AI-AGT-001` keeps agents advisory. Policy exceptions require documented risk, mitigation, owner, approver, and expiry. See [policies/](policies/) and [docs/governance/exceptions.md](docs/governance/exceptions.md).

## Developer Workflow

```text
Work Item
	-> Feature Branch
	-> Development
	-> Local Validation
	-> Commit
	-> Push
	-> Pull Request
	-> Automated Checks
	-> Human Review
	-> Approval
	-> Merge
	-> Deployment
```

The workflow is supported by:

- Branch rules in [.github/BRANCHING.md](.github/BRANCHING.md)
- PR governance in [.github/pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md)
- Ownership in [.github/CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) and [docs/governance/ownership.md](docs/governance/ownership.md)
- Completion criteria in [.github/definition-of-done.md](.github/definition-of-done.md)
- Risk classification in [docs/governance/risk-classification.md](docs/governance/risk-classification.md)
- Review routing in [docs/governance/approval-matrix.md](docs/governance/approval-matrix.md)
- Architecture baseline impact and ADRs in [docs/developer-workflow.md](docs/developer-workflow.md) and [docs/adr/](docs/adr/)
- Exceptions in [docs/governance/exceptions.md](docs/governance/exceptions.md)

## CI/CD and Enforcement

### Deterministic checks

The current core includes repository and policy validation, high-confidence secret checks, PR/risk validation hooks, artifact digest verification, and conditional hooks for dependencies, SAST, IaC, containers, tests, and coverage.

The actual GitHub workflows are:

- [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml): build and baseline repository validation
- [policy.yml](.github/workflows/policy.yml): repository, policies, exceptions, PR metadata, risk paths, and architecture baseline impact
- [security.yml](.github/workflows/security.yml): secret checks and conditional security assets
- [quality.yml](.github/workflows/quality.yml): lint and tests
- [infrastructure.yml](.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml): conditional Terraform validation
- [cd.yml](.github/workflows/cd.yml): artifact build, verification, environment promotion, and overlay hooks

No application language, dependency manifest, Dockerfile, or Terraform implementation exists in the core, so stack-specific checks report conditional or `NOT CONFIGURED` status until an overlay is selected. Full GitHub branch protection, CODEOWNER enforcement, environment reviewers, secrets, OIDC, and cloud deployment remain administrator or project-overlay configuration.

### AI-assisted checks

Agents may provide architecture reasoning, contextual security review, AI design review, code-quality reasoning, trade-off analysis, and recommendations, including baseline impact analysis for changes the Baseline Guard flags.

If a rule can be reliably checked deterministically, CI is preferred over an AI agent.

## Custom Agents

The repository contains four custom domain agents. They are repository contracts, not replacements for GitHub Copilot or an autonomous runtime. There is no separate baseline agent: the Baseline Guard reports which of these four agents should review a change.

| Agent | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [Architecture Agent](agents/architecture/AGENT.md) | Architecture, dependencies, APIs, boundaries, data contracts, ADRs |
| [Security & DevOps Agent](agents/security-devops/AGENT.md) | Security, IAM, secrets, CI/CD, IaC, environments, deployment, rollback |
| [AI Engineering Agent](agents/ai-engineering/AGENT.md) | Models, prompts, RAG, evaluations, guardrails, cost, AI risk |
| [Code Quality Agent](agents/code-quality/AGENT.md) | Maintainability, tests, complexity, duplication, documentation, errors |

## Skills

Skills are reusable analysis contracts. Agents orchestrate relevant skills rather than running every skill for every change.

```text
Architecture Agent
	├── Architecture Review
	├── Dependency Analysis
	└── ADR Review

Security & DevOps Agent
	├── Secret Review
	├── IAM Review
	├── Dependency Review
	├── CI Review
	├── CD Review
	└── IaC Review

AI Engineering Agent
	├── Model Review
	├── Prompt Review
	└── Evaluation Review

Code Quality Agent
	├── Code Review
	└── Test Review
```

The 14 skill contracts and stable IDs are under [skills/](skills/). Each defines its purpose, applicable policies, trigger, inputs, procedure, expected output, severity/confidence guidance, and human review requirements. Architecture Review (`ARCH-SK-001`) includes the baseline impact review procedure.

## Change-Aware Agent Routing

Routing is implemented as a configurable contract in [config/ai/agent-routing.yaml](config/ai/agent-routing.yaml):

```text
src/ and tests/       -> Code Quality + Architecture
infrastructure/       -> Security & DevOps (+ Architecture when the Baseline Guard flags a boundary)
ai/ and evaluations/  -> AI Engineering + Security & DevOps (+ Architecture for model and guardrail boundaries)
data contracts        -> Architecture + Security/DevOps + AI where relevant
.github/workflows/    -> Security & DevOps
policies/ and ADRs    -> Architecture
docs/architecture/baseline.yaml -> Architecture Agent, then human review
```

The Baseline Guard (`bash scripts/validate-baseline.sh`) adds the agents named by each matched baseline boundary and classifies the PR as `NO_BASELINE_IMPACT`, `BASELINE_IMPACT`, or `ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE`. A baseline change goes to the Architecture Agent, any specialist agent the ADR's affected boundaries call for, and a human reviewer.

The routing file is advisory configuration. It does not itself execute agents or call a model.

## Human-in-the-Loop

Agents are advisory and read-only by default. They must not:

- Approve production deployments
- Approve policy exceptions or risk acceptance
- Merge pull requests autonomously
- Grant IAM permissions
- Bypass CI/CD or security controls
- Approve their own findings
- Make high-risk production decisions without required human approval
- Approve architecture changes
- Modify the approved architecture baseline

```text
CI      = deterministic enforcement
Agents  = contextual analysis and recommendation
Human   = architectural decision authority
```

The architecture owner approves every `ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE`, ADR, and baseline edit; specialist owners approve per [docs/governance/approval-matrix.md](docs/governance/approval-matrix.md).

```text
Agent Finding
			-> Human Review
			-> Decision
				 ├── Accept
				 └── Reject / Challenge
			-> Required action
```

The standard finding contract is defined in [docs/agent-output.md](docs/agent-output.md). It includes finding ID, agent, skill, severity, confidence, policy ID, file/line, evidence, recommendation, human action, and disposition.

## Security Principles

The repository defines least privilege, external secret management, dependency security, secure CI/CD, production protection, sensitive-data handling, prompt-injection awareness, and auditability in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), [AI_POLICY.md](AI_POLICY.md), and [policies/ai/agent-governance.md](policies/ai/agent-governance.md).

Agent governance specifically requires read-only default operation, no production credentials, no unrestricted writes, untrusted-context handling, versioning, evidence, and human escalation.

## Using the Skeleton for a New AI Project

1. Create a new repository from this skeleton.
2. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and the applicable policies.
3. Run `bash scripts/setup.sh` and configure [PROJECT.yaml](PROJECT.yaml).
4. Replace placeholders in [.github/CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) with approved team or role handles.
5. Select a language, cloud, data platform, and deployment overlay.
6. Define project architecture, ownership, contracts, environments, and AI capabilities, and have the architecture owner complete and approve [docs/architecture/baseline.yaml](docs/architecture/baseline.yaml).
7. Configure GitHub branch protection, environment reviewers, secrets, and OIDC using [docs/administrator-setup.md](docs/administrator-setup.md).
8. Add application code, tests, infrastructure, model assets, prompts, evaluations, and guardrails.
9. Run the documented local checks before opening a PR.
10. Follow the review, approval, artifact, and promotion path.

Standardize the core policies, repository governance, agent/skill contracts, and workflow shape. Customize project source, stack overlays, environment configuration, owners, data contracts, model choices, thresholds, and deployment adapters.

## Technology-Neutral Core

The core does not assume Python, Node.js, Java, .NET, a cloud provider, or an LLM provider.

```text
Golden Path Core
			├── Language and runtime overlay
			├── Cloud and deployment overlay
			├── Data platform overlay
			└── Project-specific application and AI configuration
```

The repository currently contains no provider-specific infrastructure or application stack. Overlays add concrete build, test, dependency, IaC, container, model, and deployment behavior without weakening the core contracts.

## Current Scope and Roadmap

Currently provided:

- Repository standards and reusable structure
- Engineering, DevOps, security, data, and AI policies
- Developer workflow and repository governance
- Core deterministic CI and policy validation
- Artifact provenance, digest verification, promotion ordering, and rollback hooks
- Four custom advisory agents and 14 reusable skill contracts
- Architecture baseline, Baseline Guard, and the ADR requirement for architecture changes

Intentionally future:

- **Phase 7:** AI governance and evaluation infrastructure, including formal evaluation datasets, model-quality thresholds, and risk validation.
- **Phase 8:** agent observability, feedback storage, finding analytics, skill optimization, and automated learning loops.

Platform-specific deployment, Terraform resources, remote state, environment secrets, OIDC trust, and production adapters are optional project-overlay capabilities, not part of the technology-neutral core.

## Design Principles

1. Secure by default
2. Policy before automation
3. Deterministic checks before AI checks
4. Human accountability for high-risk decisions
5. Least privilege
6. Reusable over project-specific
7. Technology-neutral core
8. Make the right path the easiest path
9. Trace important changes, artifacts, approvals, and deployments
10. Agents assist engineers; they do not replace governance
11. Prefer simple architecture over unnecessary platform complexity
12. Fail safely
13. Lock the architecture and engineering boundaries, not every developer decision

### Avoid over-engineering

The framework does not create independent version governance for every prompt, model, context, agent, or skill, and it is not an AI configuration or version-management platform. It protects the approved architectural and engineering boundaries and reviews meaningful deviations from them.

## Getting Started

Available repository scripts:

```text
bash scripts/setup.sh
bash scripts/lint.sh
bash scripts/test.sh
bash scripts/security.sh
bash scripts/validate.sh
bash scripts/validate-policies.sh
bash scripts/validate-baseline.sh
bash scripts/test-baseline-guard.sh
bash scripts/security-check.sh
bash scripts/validate-optional-assets.sh
bash scripts/check.sh
bash scripts/build-artifact.sh
bash scripts/verify-artifact.sh
bash scripts/deployment-hook.sh
bash scripts/rollback-hook.sh
```

The core uses Bash scripts. Git Bash is supported on Windows; WSL is optional, and CI runs the scripts on Linux. The Makefile remains an optional compatibility wrapper. The core intentionally does not invent language-specific build, test, or coverage commands. Configure those in the selected stack overlay.

## Governance and Ownership

Policies are owned by their documented domain owners. Repository maintainers and CODEOWNERS review governance changes. Agent and skill changes are versioned repository changes because they can affect engineering review outcomes.

Exceptions use the standard exception template, require an owner, risk, mitigation, authorized approver, and expiry or review date, and cannot be approved by an agent. Ownership boundaries and maintenance are defined in [docs/governance/ownership.md](docs/governance/ownership.md).
